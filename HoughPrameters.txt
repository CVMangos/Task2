Line Hough Transform:
-------------------------------------------
Rho (ρ): The distance resolution in pixels of the Hough grid. It determines the accuracy of the detected lines' positions.
Theta (θ): The angular resolution in radians of the Hough grid. It defines the precision of the detected lines' orientations.
Threshold: A threshold value that determines the minimum number of votes (usually intersections in the Hough grid) 
a candidate line must receive to be considered as a detected line.

Circle Hough Transform:
--------------------------------------------------
minRadius: Minimum circle radius.
maxRadius: Maximum circle radius.
minDist: The minimum distance between the centers of detected circles.
Threshold: Similar to the line Hough Transform, it's a threshold value for the minimum number of votes required for a candidate circle to be detected.


Ellipse Hough Transform:
-----------------------------------------------
Center (x, y): Similar to circles, ellipses have a center point.
Major Axis (a): The length of the major axis of the ellipse.
Minor Axis (b): The length of the minor axis of the ellipse.
Threshold: Just like the other Hough Transforms, a threshold value to determine the minimum number of votes required for a candidate ellipse to be detected.
